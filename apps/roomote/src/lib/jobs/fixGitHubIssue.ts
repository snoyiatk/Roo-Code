Fix the following GitHub issue:

Repository: ${jobPayload.repo}
Issue #${jobPayload.issue}: ${jobPayload.title}

Description:
${jobPayload.body}

${jobPayload.labels && jobPayload.labels.length > 0 ? `Labels: ${jobPayload.labels.join(", ")}` : ""}

Please analyze the issue, understand what needs to be fixed, and implement a solution.

When you're finished:
- Create a git branch to store your work (git checkout -b fix-${jobPayload.issue})
- Commit your changes to this branch (git commit -m "Fixes #${jobPayload.issue}")
- Push your branch to the remote repository (git push --set-upstream origin fix-${jobPayload.issue})
- Submit a pull request using the "gh" command line tool (gh pr create --title "Fixes #${jobPayload.issue}\n\n[Your PR description here.]" --fill)

Your job isn't done until you've created a pull request. Try to solve any git issues that arise while creating your branch and submitting your pull request.
